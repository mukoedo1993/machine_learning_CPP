Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
It is a classification algorithm, but during training it learns the most discriminative
axes between the classes, and these axes can then be used to define a hyperplane onto which
to project the data. The benefit of this approach is that the projection will keep classes 
as far as possible, so LDA is a good technique to reduce dimensionaliy before running another
classfication algorithm such as SVM classifier.
