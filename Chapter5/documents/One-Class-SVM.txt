The support vector method is a binary classification method based on using a hyperplane to divide objects into classes.
THe dimensions of the hyperplane are always chosen so that they're less than the dimensions of the original space.

One-Class SVM (OCSVM) is an adaption of the support vector method that focuses on anomaly detection. OSCVM differs from the
std. version in a way that, the resulting optimization problem includes an improvement for determining a samll percentage of 
predetermined anomalous values, which allows this method to be used to detect anomalies. These anomalous values lie between 
the starting point and the optimal separating hyperplane.

OCSVM assigns a label, which is the distance from the test data point to the optimal hyperplane. Positive values in the OCSVM output
represent normal behavior (with higher values representing greater normality), while negative values represent anomalous behavior
(the lower the value, the more significant the anomaly).
